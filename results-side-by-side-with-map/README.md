# Results side by side with map.

This CSS is applied in the Custom CSS area while using the Mobile First Results template.

The results page must also be set to always display a map.

This can be set in the IDX Broker account.

This meant as a starter and doesn't respond fully.

Feel free to adjust and pulls welcome.
